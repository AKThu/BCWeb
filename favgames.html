        <p>
            Albion Online (AO) is a free medieval fantasy MMORPG developed by Sandbox Interactive,
             a studio based in Berlin, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
            Set in a medieval world, Albion Online is a medieval fantasy game based on the Arthurian legends,
             with militaristic strategy aspects to it. Albion Online has been translated into 11 languages and
              has over 5 million registered users.
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3><hr>
        <p>
            Albion Online's gameplay centres itself around a classless system, in which the equipment a player
             chooses to wear defines their abilities and the way they can play. Players can go out and do
             activities in Albion's world in order to gain "Fame" (Similar to Experience of other similar MMORPG's) 
             Through this Fame players can get access to other weapon and armour types, with stronger equipment
             requiring more Fame to use. Stronger gear can be used as you progress throughout the game.
             The game has a large open-world map that players can travel through. Different PVP zones offer different
             levels of risk and reward, including Yellow, Red, and Black zones; Red and Black zones featuring full 
             loot drop upon death.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game has a fully player driven economy. All equipment and items are made by other players.
            The game offers both PVE and PVP experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Development</h3><hr>
        <p>
            During the beta stages of development, players were able to purchase "Founder's Packs" to gain access
            to the closed beta play-tests which were run intermittently by Sandbox Interactive, typically after 
            an interval of a few months of development. After the release of the game, these founder's packs were 
            made unavailable for purchase. Albion Online removed its free-to-play model for various reasons on 
            December 30, 2015. (Which was then made free again at a later date)
        </p>
        <p>
            When it initially released on July 17, 2017, Albion Online offered a selection of "Starter Packs" which
            granted players access to the game and offered a varying amount of gold(In-game currency) to get started.
            Once a player purchased any of the starter packs, they would be granted open-ended access to the game with
            no extra mandatory fees. Players could also purchase membership for a limited amount of time without
            the benefits of the starter packs. On April 10, 2019, Albion Online went Free to Play. Players can also
            buy premium with in-game currency (gold & silver).
        </p>

            On March 20, 2023 a second server based in Singapore named "the east server" was opened to the public
