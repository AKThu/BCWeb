            Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating
            system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a
            Linux distribution, which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which
            are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the
            Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software
            in many distributions, causing some controversy.
