            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <pre>
        Remember me in a simple way, not what I did or said
        When I think of you now, I just think of the day we met
        Don't forget me, like I didn't care
        Yeah, I stole from myself just to make you complete

        I don't think you have the patience
        I don't think you know the difference
        (Flux, flux)
        And I don't want cute imitations
        I know you wanted to save me

        And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
        It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
        And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
        It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on

        Would you be taking me higher?
        Would we be living as liars?
        I wanna know, I wanna know

        When the memories pack up and leave, it will set me free
        All those days on the beach will be washing away from me
        I will keep it secretly just to keep the peace
        Keep steering this ship through the dark and the stormy seas

        I should be counting my blessings
        Staying safe in confusion
        (Flux, flux)
        And maybe I'm learning my lesson
        I know you wanted to save me

        I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
        It's a state of flux, but it's not enough
        And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
        It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on

        Would you be taking me higher?
        Would we be living as liars?
        I wanna know, I wanna know
        Would we be living in Camden?
        Getting a ticket to your band?
        I wanna know, I wanna know

        Ooh, ooh, ooh
        Ooh, ooh, ooh

        Oh, I'm still in love with the idea of loving you (oh, with the idea)
        It's a state of flux (it's a state of)
        But it's not enough (it's not enough)
        I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
        It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on
        (Oh, I just keep holding on)

        And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
        It's a state of flux, but it's not enough (oh, I'm still in love)
        And I'm still in love with the idea of loving you
        It's a state of flux, I just keep holding on
